#HTML, CSS, and JS

Websites are created using both HTML and CSS. HTML is used to structure the page and to add the content while CSS is used to style the content. Both HTML and CSS are equally important for the website and both of them work alongside each other. Elements have opening and closing tags and between them are the information that the computer needs to know in order to view it. Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They are found on the opening tag of the element and they have two parts: a name and a value. For example, in order to include a link in your website, you need an <a>and an element that contains the source for the link.

<a src=””> </a>

 The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements, although a few attributes (such as lang) that can appear on any element. 
 
Whatever is in the body element is the visible part of the page while the information about the page that is not displayed is in the head element. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. The Hypertext part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to link different pages together that allow visitors to move from one page to another quickly and easily. The markup language part is because it is the way you create the content of the page.

You can write your codes on the notepad that is already downloaded on your PC or you can download any text editor that you are comfortable with.

Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters: <! -- and --> tags It is a good idea to add comments to your code because comments will make it much easier to understand. Although comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page. Comments can also be used around codes to stop that code from being displayed in the browser.

Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. This attribute is usually used to give the element a distinguished style is the CSS style sheet.

Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

There are also block elements that start on a new line of the site and the inline element that can be used inside the lines to give effects to the words.

The div tag is the way you can organize your codes into parts and then style these parts and the space that they should occupy in a page.

If you want to style a part that is inside a block element you can use the span element.

You can use what is called escape characters for characters that are not found on your keyboard ones like <> and the copyright sign.

In the past, div tag was used to divide the site into parts, but now it has evolved in terms of different element that are used for different parts and sometimes it is easier because you don’t have to give each div an id to distinguish it from other div tags. We have the:

Header/footer/nav/article/aside/section/hgroup/figure/figcaption

Before you start with HTML for creating your webpage, you need to think of your audience. Think of the people that you are creating the content for. Is it going to be a company or for individual purposes? These questions will be a great help when creating your content. For the styling purposes, you need to do a wireframe which allows you to know what information you want to include on each page. Do not forget to use CSS to style your website because it will be a huge help for you visitors. You can also organize the information in groups according to the topic.

JavaScript can make the page interact with the user and make dynamic output depending on the input it gets every time. We can also modify a web page content using JavaScript. In order to write a script, you need to be familiar with the languages that the computer understands. The script is basically a number of rules given to the machine to perform certain operations.

The way you write JavaScript is similar to writing HTML and CSS but it has the extension (.js). Before you start with the actual writing, you need to have a set of goals that you want to achieve. Then you can write the steps and then the rules. When you write the rules, you can make conditions, so a different output will be given according to the input. 

Computers do not understand what everything you want to achieve in terms of their meaning in real world they only receive the instructions and then they execute them. You can make an object that resembles the real world and give it the characteristics that you want and then write a script so it will be executed in case a certain event was done by the user. Some parts of the script are done in case a change happens in the object properties and this is called a method that is triggered by the event.
